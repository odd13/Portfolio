    Over several years I have been fortunate to have had many roles and positions:
    </p>

    <p>
    Personal development: I have started to create an application that currently comprises of Ruby on Rails, Ubuntu, sqLite. This application is a basic customer management system for property maintenance. The design I have is around booking in jobs and employees, logging time on those jobs and eventually invoice management. I can provide a demonstration of this project if required.
    </p>

    <p>
    With this personal application I have been able to grasp the basic fundamentals of Ruby on Rails and I have implemented small dashboard notification system within my current workplace (Azure driven).
    </p>

    <p>
    I am Proficient in Linux based operating systems (mainly Debian and Ubuntu) and virtual private server deployment.
    </p>

    <p>
    Coding in my current position has comprised of MSSQL, SSIS business analytics (company analytic cube based on ticketing system) and small amounts of: MYSQL, sqLite, Ruby on Rails and Java. In my own time I have been learning Ruby On Rails and Meteor for a second personal application I am wanting to develop. It is vital in my mind to stick with best practices and industry standards when writing an application.
    </p>

    <p>
    The many roles I have undertaken by my current employer, as a small business, has given me the ability to think on my feet and provide solutions quickly and efficiently.
    </p>

    <p>
    Project Management in my current position is vital to ensure that the customer satisfaction is always high.
    </p>

    <p>
    Quality assurance and best practice is always a driving factor when implementing new reporting design or business analytics.
    </p>

    <p>
    Communication skills that I have gained over the years, and in my current position as Service Desk Manager, combines engaging with my team and customers on a daily basis including escalations and problem solving.
    </p>

    <p>
    Currently I am learning and implementing Dynamics 365 as our companyâ€™s content management system and overseeing that company wide process, procedures and standards are met. Prior to this I implemented Autotask as the company case management system.
    </p>

    <p>
    My personal development with ruby on rails has been a challenge however, the satisfaction I have received from creating something out of nothing and providing simple systems that save so much time is an amazing feeling. This is what is driving me to pursue a career in software development and in particular Ruby on Rails.
    </p>

    <p>
    I will be further pursuing my studies within software development as I have a strong drive for creativity.
